# Validation

bridgesim's predictions are only useful if the method is checked. Two kinds of evidence:

## 1. Textbook checks (automated, run in CI)

| Check | Reference | Test |
|---|---|---|
| Simply supported beam, mid-span point load: $\delta = PL^3/(48EI)$ within 0.5 % | Hibbeler, *Mechanics of Materials*, App. C | `tests/test_beam_validation.py` |
| Pin-jointed planar Warren truss: chord forces by the method of sections, $F = M/h$, within 1 % | Hibbeler, *Structural Analysis*, Ch. 3 | `tests/test_truss_validation.py` |
| Euler buckling of one stick: $P_{cr} = \pi^2 EI/L^2 \approx 49.75$ N (5.07 kgf) | Timoshenko & Gere | `tests/test_buckling.py` |
| Global buckling eigen-solver: pinned column $\pi^2EI/L^2$, flagpole $\pi^2EI/(2L)^2$, within 0.5 % | Euler; McGuire, Gallagher & Ziemian, Ch. 9 | `tests/test_stability.py` |
| Rectangle section properties and torsion constant | Roark, Table 10.7 | `tests/test_sections.py` |
| Pynite local-axis orientation (b ≠ d cantilevers) | Pynite 3.2.0 source | `tests/test_orientation.py` |
| Plate load distribution sums to $P$ and is symmetric | statics | `tests/test_loads.py` |

`textbook/` is for worked examples (hand calculations, spreadsheets) that back these tests.

## 2. Physical tests (your team, planned support in v0.2)

`physical/` holds CSV templates. Fill them with your own tests, then update
`materials/*.yaml` (and mark values `source: measured`). Suggested tests:

* **Stick bending (E and f_b)**: three-point bending of single sticks,
  $E = F L^3 / (48\,\delta\,I)$, $f_b = M_{max}/S = (F_{max} L/4)/(b t^2/6)$.
* **Glued lap joint (τ_g)**: two sticks overlapped by a known length, pulled to failure:
  $\tau_g = F_{max} / (\text{overlap} \times \text{width})$.
* **Short column (f_c) and buckling**: laminated stacks of increasing length.
* **Prototype crush**: a sub-assembly or a scaled bridge, compared with the prediction.
